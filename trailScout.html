                            Trail Scout is a path navigation application for recreational hikes when on a hike. Imagine planning a safe, worry-free
                            hiking trip. This requires a lot of research and experience that many beginners lack. The possibility of wandering
                            off-course and getting lost causes fear and anxiety, preventing hikers from exploring new trails. Coming into contact
                            with an unexpected animal, person, or trail obstacle can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Trail Scout
                            guides the hikers and helps avoid all such obstacles with the help of a bird-like drone and a mobile application
                            to eliminate fear of the unknown and give them the peace of mind they need.

                            We prepared a set of questions and asked them to recreational hikers we knew. We wanted to know their hike experiences
                            and problems. Based on the findings from the interviews, each one of us came up with 10 ideas each which we arranged
                            in the form of cards. We categorised these cards in categories and then rated them to shortlist the top-rated ideas.
                            This phase included letting go off a lot of ideas we thought would really work and bringing back cards as wildcards.
                            After careful research and observations from interviews, we found that the hikers needed a real-time navigation and
                            monitoring system that would take hikers where they want to go, based on what they like and dislike.

                    <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
                    <h5>Iteration A - Helicopter drone</h5>
                    <div class="row text-justify">
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            We wanted the drone see everywhere, so we thought of a spherical structure with a 360<sup>o</sup> view attached
                            to a helicopter like rotor blades. Initial user feedback indicated that the spherical drone design would stick out
                            like a sore thumb in the middle of a natural setting. The appearance may distract from the serene experience.
                            Also received good feedback on a “street-view’ type vision system.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-center mb-2"><img src="images/trailScout/droneDesign1.png" alt="Card sorting technique" class="img-fluid"></p>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Iteration B - Bird drone</h5>
                    <div class="row text-justify">
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            From the feedback on the first iteration, we realised that the hikers were concerned if the drone would
                            blend into nature or not. They also felt that other hikers might get annoyed with the helicopter design
                            since it would intrude their privacy and even they want a break from their concrete life. Hikers also
                            felt that it looked very technical and would easily break if it flew into something. The most positive
                            feedback on the drone was that the metal surface made it easily noticeable and would prevent it from
                            getting lost in the environment. We used this feedback to make a bird-like drone with a metallic body
                            so that it would look like a bird but also stay noticeable. The camera was fitted in the eyes and a
                            flashlight at the bottom for visibility at night.

                    <h3>Application Prototype</h3>
                    <div class="row text-justify">
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            The application’s use is two-fold. For new users, the application saves initial user and drone settings.
                            The application works only when connected to the drone. Second, when the hiker is on the hike, he can
                            search for the hike in the application and the drone would suggest the safe and unsafe paths as they
                            come. The user can also connect with friends and track their locations on the hike. From the initial
                            prototype feedback, we found out that hikers also wanted to keep track of their previous treks. So we
                            added a tab for recent tracks. The user can also set other user preferences like scenic views, water
                            bodies, wildlife and landmarks to help the drone suggest a more likely path.
