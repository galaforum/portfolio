                            UNCC transient is a dashboard interface for UNC Charlotte bus stops. We researched on how people needed more
                            than a mobile application and found out that a dashboard interface to get bus updates at the bus stops would
                            be a great alternative to alleviate people’s pains. UNCC Transient provides easy and accessible bus information
                            at UNCC bus stops and is also a source of entertainment at bus stops other than updating people with bus timings,
                            route information and bus statistics.

                            We talked with people waiting at bus stops to get an insight on their experiences with the UNCC buses. We talked
                            with bus drivers who told us that bus delays were caused due to bus driver shift changes and inevitable bathroom breaks. We also
                            got an opportunity to talk to the bus supervisor who was kind enough to give us useful information about how the buses run and
                            how they could not control the constant use of the pedestrian push buttons at some overcrowded campus signals which led to the
                            pedestrian signal being green very often and making the buses wait.


                            We conducted semi-structured interviews to get answers on basic questions like bus travel experiences and expected enhancements
                            in the bus system to find out the most suitable solution. We concluded that people got frustrated with not being updated with the
                            bus schedules and delays. We also found out that people sometimes got bored of waiting at the bus stops and chose to walk to
                            their destinations. The semi-structured interviews helped us create multiple (three) user personas. I created the user persona
                            for Peter.

                            The user personas motivated us to create user storyboards and visually predict a user’s experience with the product. With the

                            having the trouble of taking out their phone from their pocket, opening the bus mobile application, selecting the bus route,
                            scrolling to the current bus stop and seeing the bus arrival time.
