                            UNCC transient is a dashboard interface for UNC Charlotte bus stops. It provides easy and accessible bus information
                            at UNCC bus stops and is also a source of entertainment at bus stops other than updating people with bus timings,
                            route information and bus statistics. We researched on how people needed more than a mobile application and found
                            out that a dashboard interface to get bus updates at the bus stops would be a great alternative to alleviate
                            people’s pains and boredom.

                            We talked with people waiting at bus stops to get an insight on their experiences with the UNCC buses. We talked
                            with bus drivers who told us that bus delays were caused due to bus driver shift changes and inevitable bathroom breaks. We also
                            got an opportunity to talk to the bus supervisor who was kind enough to give us useful information about how the buses run and
                            how they could not control the constant use of the pedestrian push buttons at some overcrowded campus signals which led to the
                            pedestrian signal being green very often and making the buses wait.


                            We conducted semi-structured interviews to get answers on basic questions like bus travel experiences and expected enhancements
                            in the bus system to find out the most suitable solution. We concluded that people got frustrated with not being updated with the
                            bus schedules and delays. We also found out that people sometimes got bored of waiting at the bus stops and chose to walk to
                            their destinations. The semi-structured interviews helped us create multiple (three) user personas. I created the user persona
                            for Peter.

                                            the buses for 10 years, and he loves his job. William is married and has
                                            3 children. His hobbies include gardening and building model trains. William lives a bit away

                                            time. All the people who got on the bus were very cooperative. His shift ended on time
                                            because the next driver on duty reached the bus stop before time.

                                            frustrated the passengers. Also, he could not take his lunch break either as his driver replacement was late.

                            The user personas motivated us to create user storyboards and visually predict a user’s experience with the product. With the
                            below storyboard, I tried to portray that a university student (or any person at the bus stop) could get bus updates without
                            having the trouble of taking out their phone from their pocket, opening the bus mobile application, selecting the bus route,
                            scrolling to the current bus stop and seeing the bus arrival time.

                            The design prototype is a one-screen prototype with each section showing respective information when clicked
                            on. We wanted to keep the number of screens and information to a minimal to avoid confusing the users, so we
                            decided to choose this design pattern.
                            The header of all the screens shows the bus routes that stop at that particular station, name of the bus stop
                            and emergency alerts.
                            The design has four other sections. The Bus Stats section has bus analysis graphs like Trip Interruption Log,
                            Traffic Peak Hours Graph and Live Bus Occupancy Graph.
                            The Next Bus section shows expected bus arrival time.
                            The Map and Destination icons show bus route maps and provide a destination station route search feature
                            respectively.
                            The section at the bottom is navigation for entertainment sources like games, music, Youtube and Google.
