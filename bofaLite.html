                            The Bank of America Lite application is the lighter version of the original Bank of America application. It is a stripped down
                            version that offers deeper functionality at the cost of memory space and device resources.
                            It is an intuitive application that
                            lets users manage their bank accounts and perform all basic tasks including viewing recent transactions, money transfer,
                            managing their FICO score and managing their rewards.
                            The possibility of getting lost and feeling
                            confused while trying to do something in a heavy application with a lot of features has been the key motivation for the Lite application.

                            The Bank of America application is very useful and shows most of the account details to the users. However, sometimes too many
                            features confuse the user, especially new users and make it difficult to find the information they want. The application is
                            intuitive but there is a need for a lighter application that solves basic user problems as not all users use all the features
                            provided by the application.

                            The idea behind a Lite application is originally inspired by Facebook which also has a Facebook Lite application
                            which I have been using for a while. The original application becomes heavy in terms of storage space and provides a lot of
                            features. The Lite application is small and saves space on the phone and also works well in sparse network conditions.

                          I conducted a google forms survey on 16 people. I asked them to fill the survey about what features they used in the
                          original bank application. From the responses of the group, I figured that they performed very basic tasks on the
                          application including viewing recent transactions, money transfer, managing their FICO score and managing rewards.

                          a year back, so they were comparatively new users. Others had been using the application for a while now and were
                          helpful in giving constructive feedback.

                            1. <b>User research helps understand pain points</b> - User research helps undertand what users really need and what they want. It also helps to understand what confuses them and what they don't need.
