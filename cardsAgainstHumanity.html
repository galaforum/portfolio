                            Cards against humanity is a fun card game which we transformed into a digital game in the form of a mobile application. The card game is simple. In each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else
                            answers with their funniest white card. The player with the funniest white card wins a point. In the digital game, we let the users choose random players to play with also and gave different screen views for the players and the judge.

                            We used paper prototypes because they are a very interactive and fundamental way of portraying how an application would work and they
                            are basic in its form, making it easy to test and get initial feedback form users before diving into the design of the
                            actual prototype. The process started with some initial sketching of how we wanted the interface to look. We did not want to
                            complicate the game too much as the original game is effortless. After the initial mockup was ready, we
                            conducted the Wizard of Oz study on random people to get feedback about the application’s features. From
                            the feedback, we made a few modifications like changing the prize icon to the current leaderboard icon
                            in the bottom navigation bar and changing the description texts on a few screens.
                            The images below are a few screens from the paper prototype.
